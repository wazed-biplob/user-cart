# Mongoose Express CRUD API Demonstration ðŸ‘‹

by : [@wazed_biplob](https://github.com/wazed-biplob)

## Features

This project demonstrates basic CRUD operations using Moongoose Schema with Typescript in an Express Application. The main features of this project are :

- Strict Data Model Definition using Typescript
- Strict Structure of Data Model with Moongoose
- Validation of Data and their types using Zod
- Smooth API request and response error handler
- Showing Relevant Messages and Status Codes in response
- Password Hashing for Extra Security
- Hiding Password Field in API Responses
- Parsed By EsLint to find out errors before runtime

## Description

I've developed a Node.js Express application with TypeScript, integrating MongoDB with Mongoose for user data and order management. I have ensured data integrity through validation using Zod.
